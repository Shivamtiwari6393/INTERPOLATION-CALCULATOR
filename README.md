# INTERPOLATION-CALCULATOR

It works on the Newton-Gregory forword interpolation formula for equal interval.

The Newton-Gregory interpolation formula for equal interval is a method of finding an interpolating polynomial that passes through a given set of data points with equal spacing between them. The formula is based on the idea of using the forward or backward differences of the function values to construct the coefficients of the polynomial.

# How to use this calculator:

1.  Enter value of X with equal intervals. Ex: 3,6,9,12,15.
2.  Enter values of Y.
3.  Enter the point. (any value between the first value and the last of X)
4.  Click submit.
